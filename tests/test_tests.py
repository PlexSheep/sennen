# Note: these weird arguments are an indicator of what should be done before. For example,
# `temp_data_dir` is a function in `conftest.py`. If we put it in the arguments, it seems
# to run before our test, and the return value becomes a local.
#
# This is all very confusing for someone used to Rust's libtest
